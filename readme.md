# GSDC Fev Fest 

## Introduction
To tackle both waste management and limiting carbon footprint, we have created **Sospeso**. Meaning "Pending" in Italian. It tackles issues of large amounts of packaging for common house hold goods. By creating group baskets the website can be used to purchase a larger quantity of items. This is a week long hackathon where I build a full stack website completing the function required. For more info read the "whitepaper.doc"
